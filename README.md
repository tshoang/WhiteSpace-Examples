# WhiteSpace-Examples
Repositories for WhiteSpace examples. Each example should be in a
separate folder.
- Please use `*.ws` for your program in WhiteSpace (and yes,
  commenting your code is highly recommended).
- Please use `*.md`for description and expected results.
See for example `Fibonacci` folder. 

Please indicate your contribution in the *.md* file, e.g., put this at
the end of the files `*Contributor: Name FamilyName*`/
